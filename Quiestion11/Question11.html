    <!-- A Sandwich Calculator
1. Write a function called sandwich calculator. This should accept one value:
slicesOfBread
2. The function should return the total number of possible sandwiches based
on the amount of slices available, so if there are 10 slices, it should return
5. Test your function with an alert box.
3. Extend your function so it accepts two values, slicesOfBread and
slicesOfCheese.
4. It takes two slices of bread and one of cheese to make a sandwich. The
function should return the total number of possible sandwiches, so if there
are 10 slices of bread, but only 1 of cheese, it should return 1. You'll need
an if statement to make this work. -->
